# Combots
A project to simulate the communication between Master and Slave robots.
This project implements Master and Slave programs running as ROS nodes. 
- ROS is a set of software tools that allows different components of a robotics system to communicate and function together.
- Nodes are the functional pieces of a ROS system. 
- ROS nodes communicate using XMLRPC, which is based on HTML
The project will implement nodes to identify, distribute, execute and keep track of arbitrary tasks.
